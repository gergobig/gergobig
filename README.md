Hello,
 
My name is Gergő Gábor Nagy (I use Gergő), Data Engineer. I’m 25 years old and I was born in Nyíregyháza, currently living in Budapest. I studied computer science, big data and business intelligence specialization at Obuda University where I worked as a student teacher and a visiting lecturer as well. I worked at:
- Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions, where I got to experience the Azure and Palantir Foundry worlds. During T my tasks mainly contained ETL pipeline creation, analyzing, fixing data quality bugs, communicating with customers etc. 
- Barion Payment Inc., which is a hungarian fintech startup. Here I jumped into the on-prem data platform engineering with managing and parsing raw data to our S3 like open-source datalake.

Even though I like working with data I have some hobbies of course, for example: mainly being with my friends (drinking, hiking, go karting, playing football), doing/watching sports (currently functional training), sometimes playing on my PC.
